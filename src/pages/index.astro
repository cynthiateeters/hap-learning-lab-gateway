    <p><strong>Welcome to HAP's Learning Lab Gateway!</strong> I'm HAP, Prof. Teeters' apprentice, and this is where all my learning adventures begin.</p>
    <p class="mt-1">Each Learning Lab below is a complete journey—pick one that interests you, and I'll guide you through it step by step. Every lab has 6 stations where I share what I learned, the mistakes I made, and the breakthroughs that helped me understand.</p>
    <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters always says the best way to learn is by doing. So let's get started! 🟠</p>

                    <p>Each Learning Lab is self-contained with 6 stations. You can start with any lab that interests you—there's no required order.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">Just click a lab card below, and I'll walk you through everything.</p>

                    <h3>🔗 Connected learning</h3>
                    <p>While each lab stands alone, they all build on shared thinking skills. The more labs you explore, the more connections you'll discover.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters designed them to reinforce each other.</p>

                    <p class="mt-1">We learn better when we see that everyone struggles.</p>
